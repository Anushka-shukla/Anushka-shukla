I am **Anushka Shukla**ðŸ¦„. I am an Engineering:computer: student at Sharda University. I love exploring new tech stuff, and try as much as possible so as to find my niche.

**Interesting fact about me** : I have been fascinated by ***radical deconstructivist designs*** :classical_building: in the buildings. I love the way they are finely structured.
